# MyFirstSpringApp
Trainng with using Java Spring for creating basic web aplications.
Actually, Spring Boot is much easier than ASP.NET in terms of creating new stuff, although ASP MVC + EF has an edge in terms of time to implement basic CRUD features.
However, subsequent work that one need to do with the code is much more "fun" and creative when using Spring.
